# Evolving Artificial Life (The Dream)

In this section I will write down some basic ideas of a simulation capable of evolving artificial life (AL) from a set of simple building blocks, which I will call 'atoms'. 

The simulation will run in a virtual geometric bounded but scale-less space, called the 'environment' consisting out of parametric 'gradients' and 'cycles' that affect those gradients. Gradients are what make up the artifical parametric space but can be thought of as abstract incarnations of the gradients we experience in the real world, such as temperature, humidity, food density, osmolarity, and so on. However, in our environment gradients are not required to carry any such concrete meaning. Cycles describe time-dependent changes on those gradients, much like in the real world we have seasons, day-night cycles, food cycles. and so on. Like gradients, our cycles are completely abstract and don't require a natural world counterpart.  

Our environment will also contain an initial set of diverse building blocks (atoms) that form the artificial 'chemistry'. Just as real atoms, they will have different characteristics, and rules (physics) govern how these atoms interact with each other and how the local environment can effect atom characteristics. Unlike real-world atoms, our atoms are dimensionless and abstract entities, but they do have a geometry (shape). Such abstract atoms are in principle just as suitable to take part in any complex dynamical system as seen at the level of real-world atoms, molecules, cellular and multi-cellular life, organs, complete organisms, ecology, and who knows what else. Moreover, the number of atom species can change as the simulation progresses as I will explain next.

Just as in the real world, the atoms, and physics make up an astronomically large possibility space. Besides the rules that govern the inter atom and environment interactions, another set of rules need to be defined that will take on the form of parametric thresholds. These thresholds can be seen as 'selection criteria': as soon as a threshold is exceeded, the 'entity' (usually a set of interacting atoms) responsible is selected and stored as a new atom which can be added to the mix of building blocks in other environments and simulations. The criteria that make up these thresholds will select for some form of emergent complexity arising from running the simulation. Criteria could be selecting for certain geometric properties (size or aggregation, shape), movement, emerging network-like interactions, equilibrium disturbers (think enzymes?), and so on. 

In summary, the 'game' is about creating a combination of environment, atoms and physics that gives rise to emergent complexity. Criteria are defined to identify such emergent complexity and reuse it in the same or other environments enabling even more complexity to arise. The end goal is evolving enough complexity so that at a certain point the artificial system passes the definition of being 'alive':

- able to reproduce
- has a metabolism (need for energy from environment)
- evolve ('information' storage)
- maintain homeostasis
